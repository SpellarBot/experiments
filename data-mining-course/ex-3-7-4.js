/**
 * Exercise 3.7.4 : Suppose we form sketches using the four vectors
 * from Exercise 3.7.2.
 * 
 * (a) What are the constraints on a, b, c, and d that will cause the
 *     sketch of the vector [a, b, c, d] to be [+1, +1, +1, +1]?
 * (b) Consider two vectors [a, b, c, d] and [e, f, g, h]. What are
 *     the conditions on a, b, . . . , h that will make the sketches of
 *     these two vectors be the same?
