/**
 * Exercise 3.3.4 : Now that we know Jaccard similarity is related to
 * the probability that two sets minhash to the same value, reconsider
 * Exercise 3.1.3. Can you use this relationship to simplify the problem
 * of computing the expected Jaccard similarity of randomly chosen sets?
 */

// Recall Exercise 3.1.3:
/**
 * Exercise 3.1.3 : Suppose we have a universal set U of n elements,
 * and we choose two subsets S and T at random, each with m of the
 * n elements. What is the expected value of the Jaccard similarity
 * of S and T ?
 */

// I believe this could solved by reading through 3.3.3
