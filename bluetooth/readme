# Bluetooth

## Installation

The default Ubuntu 14.04 bluetooth installation worked but does not
come with useful developer tools. To install the bluez (the Linux
bluetooth protocol stack) and some utilities run:

	sudo apt-get install bluez bluez-utils

## Starting the Bluetooth Service

To start the bluetooth service run:

	sudo service bluetooth start

## Stopping the Bluetooth Service

To stop the bluetooth service run:

	sudo service bluetooth stop

## Is bluetooth running?

To see if the bluetooth service is running use:

	sudo service --status-all 2>/dev/null | grep bluetooth

You will see one of (the stuff in parenthesis is my explaination of the
output):

	 [ + ]  bluetooth (it is running)
	 [ - ]  bluetooth (it is not running)
	 [ ? ]  bluetooth (unknown)

## Listing Bluetooth Radios

Run:

	hcitool dev

It will produce output similar to:

	Devices:
		hci0	48:2D:AA:BB:CC:03

## TODO

Having knowledge of D-BUS seems like it would be helpful. I'm taking a
break from bluetooth specifically to look at D-BUS (not the car).
