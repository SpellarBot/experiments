Spotify Puzzles - Reverse Binary
=============================================================================

## Task

Your task will be to write a program for reversing numbers in binary. For
instance, the binary representation of 13 is 1101, and reversing it gives
1011, which corresponds to number 11.

## Input

The input contains a single line with an integer N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.

## Output

Output one line with one integer, the number we get by reversing the binary
representation of N.

## Solutions

I wrote 3 solutions (C, C++, Python). Each use the same bit manipulations but
the input and output has been tailored for the particular language. 

They probably will not work on 'Little Endian' machines. I assume that the
most significant bit is on the 'left'. I also assume a 32 bit integer size.
