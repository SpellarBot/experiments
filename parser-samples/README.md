parser-samples
==============

This is where I do cool stuff with parser generators like Flex/Bison.

The examples numbered 1 through 15 all use jison - a javascript version of
Flex/Bison. I wanted to focus on the lexer/parser stuff and not worry about
data types.

Examples 15 through 21 use Flex/Bison and C. The code is very similar to the 
javascript version but has some tricky details.
