I would recommend following the examples in the following order:

 - dc.net: how to vary the voltage of a DC source and see the results
   for each voltage step
 - tf.net: how to compute and plot a transfer function for a circuit
 - ac.net: how to analyze the output of a circuit under different input
   input frequencies (ie the frequency response of a filter)
 - noise.net: don't bother reading this one
 - variable.net: see the output of multiple analyses after changing any
   parameter (in this case the resistance of a resistor)
