# Python Distutils Basic Executable

This should install `runner` in `/usr/bin` (or equivalent) so can run
`runner` and see "Hello World!" as output.

## MANIFEST.in

This lists all of the files that will included in the final distribution.

## Building

To build the distributable file run:

	python setup.py sdist

That will create a folder `dist` which holds the distributable archive.
You can then extract the archive and install everything by running:

	python setup.py install
