# Python Distutils Basic Executable

This should install `runner` in `/usr/bin` (or equivalent) so can run
`runner` and see "Hello World!" as output.

## MANIFEST.in

Note, we don't need to manually create the manifest file. The setup
script can handle including code for custom python modules. If you need
to include other files (ie from the root of your source or from outside
the module's directory) then you may need a custom MANIFEST.in file.

## Building

To build the distributable file run:

	python setup.py sdist

That will create a folder `dist` which holds the distributable archive.
You can then extract the archive and install everything by running:

	python setup.py install
