# JS Sets

I wanted to learn about set theory and I wanted to write some self
documenting code. This project is my attempt at both.

Each js file is markdown text explaining certain concepts in set theory with
the relavant code. You can run it through your favorite markdown parser and
get a nice paper on set theory.

If you want to actually use the code: `build.sh` extracts all of the code
from the appropriate js files and combines it into a single file called
`main.js`. `test.js` is also appended to the file so I can test some basic
features out.

The library also has a dual api. The first is using C-style objects:

	var a = new Set();
	Set.addMember( a, 1 );
	Set.addMember( a, 2 );
	var b = new Set();
	Set.addMember( b, 3 );
	var u = Set.union( a, b );

The second uses C++ style objects:

	var a = new Set();
	a.addMember(1).addMember(2);
	var b = new Set();
	b.addMember(3);
	a.union(b);
